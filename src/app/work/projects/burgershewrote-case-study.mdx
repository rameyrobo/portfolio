## Burger She Wrote — Accessibility & speed on Divi, without compromise

> A case study of delivering a **high‑performing, WCAG‑compliant** website on **Divi**, a page builder notorious for bloat. The result: **100% accessibility scores** and lightning‑fast performance on Google PageSpeed Insights.

## The challenge

The Burger She Wrote team needed a site that could **showcase their brand**, support heavy traffic, and comply with **WCAG / ADA accessibility standards**. The catch? It was already built on **Divi**, which most developers avoid for performance and compliance reasons. The challenge was to **work within Divi** while ensuring the site stayed **fast, accessible, and future‑proof**.

## My role

I handled **optimization, accessibility, and technical improvements** end‑to‑end:

- Audited Divi output for accessibility violations and performance bottlenecks.
- Tuned site for WCAG / ADA compliance.
- Optimized assets, caching, and delivery for fast load times.
- Integrated SEO and analytics.

## Solution overview

- **Platform:** WordPress with Divi 5.0 (migrated from Divi 4.0).
- **Accessibility:** Implemented semantic markup, ARIA roles, proper labels, focus states, and color‑contrast adjustments to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Performance:** Minified and deferred scripts, optimized images, improved caching and CDN delivery, and cleaned unused Divi modules.
- **SEO & analytics:** Added structured data, improved metadata, and integrated Google Analytics.

## Experience design

- **Accessible navigation:** Proper tab order, focus states, and ARIA attributes ensure the site is fully usable by screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **High contrast design:** Adjusted color palette and backgrounds for readability without losing brand identity.
- **Responsive layouts:** Verified across devices and browsers for consistent accessibility.

## Performance & compliance results

- **100% Accessibility score** on Google PageSpeed Insights.
- **Consistently fast load times** despite being built on Divi.
- **Improved Core Web Vitals**: CLS, LCP, and FID all passing thresholds.
- WCAG / ADA compliance validated through audits and automated testing.

## Engineering highlights

- Overrode Divi defaults to reduce bloat and improve semantics.
- Custom CSS/JS enhancements to replace inaccessible default modules.
- Implemented lazy loading, deferred assets, and optimized image formats.
- Added structured metadata for SEO and ADA‑friendly content labeling.

## What I shipped

- Divi‑based WordPress site with **100% accessibility score**.
- **PageSpeed Insights optimizations** for desktop and mobile.
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through semantic markup and ARIA attributes.
- SEO updates and structured data integration.

## Stack

**WordPress**, **Divi 5.0**, **Custom CSS/JS overrides**, **Google PageSpeed Insights**, **WCAG/ADA testing tools**.

## Outcome

A **modern, fast, and fully accessible site** built on Divi—proving that even a page builder with a reputation for bloat can deliver **100% accessibility and performance scores** with the right engineering and optimization.
