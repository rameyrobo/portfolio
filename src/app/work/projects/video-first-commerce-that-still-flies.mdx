## Overview

A case study of building a **design‑forward, video‑heavy** site that **stays fast**, integrates **ecommerce with gated uploads**, and drives **high session engagement** with modern UX patterns.

## The challenge

Create a cinematic, media‑dense experience—hero videos, autoplaying grids, and full‑screen modals—**without** crushing performance. Pair that with a **storefront that accepts customer uploads** (songs, images/video), but only **after purchase** to prevent spam, while keeping the UI delightful and accessible across browsers (including Safari/IG webviews).

## Solution overview

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- **Commerce:** Snipcart for cart/checkout, with **custom product options**, **stackable add‑ons**, **subscriptions**, and **post‑purchase upload**.
- **Media pipeline:** Video and image assets delivered via **Bunny.net CDN**; responsive poster/thumbnail system with dynamic sizes.
- **Emails & analytics:** **Resend** for transactional emails (order/upload confirmations), **GA4** and **Vercel Analytics** for behavior and performance insights.
- **Hosting:** Vercel, with **Edge** components where helpful.


## Experience design

- **Immersive video grid:** Autoplay/mute logic that responds to viewport visibility using **IntersectionObserver** with sensible thresholds; **ESC** closes modals and videos universally.
- **Hero & gallery:** Dynamic poster selection, responsive `Image` sizing, and fallbacks (H.264 MP4/WebM/JPG) for stubborn browsers.
- **Product exploration:** Deep‑linked **product modals** (PDPs) with history navigation (back/forward) so users never lose their place.
- **Carousels & showcases:** "Add yourself" character carousel, commercial reels, and context‑aware video sections.

## Commerce & uploads (anti‑spam by design)

1. User configures a product (custom fields, quantity, optional add‑ons).
2. Checkout completes in Snipcart (**client‑side hooks** wired to `cart.confirmed`).
3. The site **unlocks the upload flow** and provides a **unique upload link**.
4. Uploads are persisted to **Bunny.net storage** and associated with the order.
5. **Resend** emails the customer a confirmation + secure download link.

This sequence **prevents drive‑by uploads**, keeps storage clean, and aligns costs with revenue.

## Performance strategy

![Mudderfuger Page Speed](/images/projects/mudderfuger/mudderfuger-pagespeed.png "Mudderfuger PageSpeed Insights Results")

- **Lazy‑everything:** Defer Snipcart JS/CSS, modal code‑splitting, and metadata‑only video preloads.
- **Adaptive media:** Dynamic poster sizes, `sizes` on images, JPG fallbacks; H.264 vs WebM preference toggled per browser.
- **Viewport control:** Pauses any playing video when it leaves the viewport; defers thumbnail generation until idle.
- **Lightweight UI:** Tailwind utilities with **reusable components** and minimal runtime overhead

## Engineering highlights

- **Upload‑aware router** that only enables media submissions **after** verified payment.
- **Custom product fields** flowing from UI → cart → order metadata.
- **Password‑protected promo** subdomain instance for promotional stakeholder screening.
- **Global keyboard UX** (ESC to close modals/videos) and pointer‑/focus‑friendly controls.
- **Accessibility pass** (labels, focus order, color contrast), plus mobile‑first tap targets.

## What I shipped

- Video grid with **autoplay/mute**, **scroll‑pause**, and **JPG poster fallbacks**.
- **Responsive media system** (thumbnails, posters, webp/jpg/mp4/webm) with browser‑specific preferences.
- Snipcart install with **custom styles**, **line‑item options**, and **subscription products**.
- **Upload pipeline**: post‑purchase gating → upload form → Bunny.net storage → confirmation email via Resend.
- Analytics: **GA4** (deferred) + **Vercel Analytics**.
- **Static product index** for cart validation and discoverability.

## Stack

**Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Snipcart**, **Bunny.net (CDN + storage)**, **Resend**, **Vercel (Edge + analytics)**, **GA4**.

## Notes from the trenches

- Safari and IG webviews required **poster/thumbnail pragmatism**—I implemented explicit JPG fallbacks and preload hints to avoid blank videos.
- Built **static product index** pages to help Snipcart crawl and validate all items.
- Implemented **modal routing** and history management to keep users oriented while exploring.

## Outcome

A **cinematic storefront** that **loads quickly**, **behaves predictably** across browsers, and **channels creativity into conversion**. The result is a modern experience that treats media as a first‑class citizen **without** sacrificing speed or purchase flow integrity.
